## Charter

### Team Members

### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?**
  We will encourage an open environment and provde constructive criticism without placing blame.

* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
  If situations spiral outside of our ability to handle them like adults, we will consult with instructors.

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
  Since our group has a great deal of flexibility when it comes to working hours, we will use strong communication to work asynchronously and assure that we're all in the loop.

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
  If we run into issues meeting deadlines, we feel comfortable that the group can provide support to get us across the line.

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
  Using tools like GitHub's tracking board will allow us to stay on the same page.


### Goals

* **Overall: What is our overall objective for the Learn & Be Curious unit?**
  We're excited for the opportunity to take tools and techniques we've encountered in exercises and put them to use in scenarios with more opportunity for creativity.


* **Performance: What do we want to prioritize in terms of what we achieve?**
 We've already discussed methods for reaching MVP. We've marked several good ideas 'stretch goals' - things to revisit if we have time.


* **Learning: What are the things that our team wants to learn?**
  Since we've spent the entirety of our time on back-end development, all members of the team are interested in trying front-end.


* **Task processes: What processes will our team follow to meet our goals, complete tasks, or to build team relationships?**
  We're all pretty comfortable using asynchronous collaboration tools to work outside of scheduled class time. We have discussed the possibility of meeting up in person for collaborative coding sessions.

## Meaning & Impact

**What is personally important for each team member about becoming an SDE?**

* _Team Member A_:
* Cliff: I want to be challenged and solve new problems. It is important to me to continue to learn new things and find new ways to solve problems.
* _Team Member C_:
* Tom: I've always enjoyed designing and building new solutions to difficult problems, and I find infrastructure puzzles to be particularly interesting. I'm hoping to find a role to let me explore that further.

**What each team member wants to achieve: e.g. improve analytical skills, learn project management skills, develop public speaking skills, speak up more, speak up less, etc.**

* _Team Member A_:
* Cliff: I aim to increase my ability to design and understand project architecture as well as increase my knowledge and skill in front-end development.
* _Team Member C_:
* Tom: I continue to be interested in understanding how to solve problems in sustainable, repeatable, extensible fashion rather than implementing a fast solution which won't be re-usable or even usable long-term.

## Team Member Roles and Responsibilities

_Presently, we think we have a comfortable collaborative balance without formally assigning roles. If necessary, we'll revisit._
