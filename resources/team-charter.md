### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?**
  We will encourage an open environment and provde constructive criticism without placing blame.

* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
  If situations spiral outside of our ability to handle them like adults, we will consult with instructors.

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
  Since our group has a great deal of flexibility when it comes to working hours, we will use strong communication to work asynchronously and assure that we're all in the loop.

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
  If we run into issues meeting deadlines, we feel comfortable that the group can provide support to get us across the line.

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
  Using tools like GitHub's tracking board will allow us to stay on the same page.
