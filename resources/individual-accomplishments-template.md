# Accomplishment Tracking - TEMPLATE

## Background

It's a great habit to record accomplishments and progress throughout your SDE career. It's useful to reflect on what you've worked on in the past and comes in handy during performance reviews and promotion cycles.

## Instructions

_Save a copy of this document in somewhere that you'll have access to after you finish this program. You might want to keep this in GitHub, Google Docs, or your favorite note taking app._

Using the below template, keep track of what you’ve worked on each week during the unit. 1-3 bullets under each section for each week should suffice. This should only take 5 - 10 minutes of reflection each week.

As you track your work, think about how it relates to the SDE fundamental skills laid out in the syllabus and how you are practicing them.

* Converts a design into code and delivers it using best practices
* Writes secure, testable, maintainable code
* Understands when to use (or not) a broad range of data structures and algorithms
* Creates unit tests that thoroughly test functionality
* Troubleshoots by debugging and reviewing errors, logfiles, and metrics
* Contributes to planning and design
* Escalates when projects hit roadblocks and risks

The important work samples don’t only include the things you authored, but should include things like key PRs you reviewed that you are proud of as well!

_You will submit your completed Accomplishment Tracking Document to your instructors by the end of the unit._

## Week 1

**Goals:**
    1.  Create and submit team charter
    2.  Review design doc and provide feedback.

**Activity:**
    I was not able to be as big a part of the project planning phase as I hoped because I I have to work after class 
    each day.  To give me a chance to participate Tom sent me the first draft of the doc via Slack and I went over
    it and asked questions and gave feedback.

**Important Docs, Commits, or Pull Requests**:

**Things learned:**
   We will definitely have to figure out how to use the "vertical slices" method so I am not holding up
   teammates who are done with their Sprint activity for the week and can take on the next step.
